# React Components

## Description

Component is a repo filled with React reusable components 

## Creating Reusable Components

### 1. Identify redundant JSX

### 2. Intuitively name redundant JSX  
*Naming is important*

### 3. Create new component file with component name
*Houses new component, named the same as the component*

### 4. Add redundant JSX into new file

### 5. Configure component (i.e.- props)
*Props: Passing data from parent to child component (nested component)*

-Props is short for properties
-Props pass data from parent to child
-Technically there is no limit on prop data that can be passed; however there are some best practices

*Allows for configuration of customization of child components based on dynamic data*
